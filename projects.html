          As of right now, I am just a student at Dublin High School in the 11th grade, however, I plan on expanding my knowledge in the computer science and engineering fields during high school as well. But you cannot be just an engineer and only know engineering. Therefore, I took numerous rigorous courses to challenge my abilities to manage workload including AP European History, AP Chemistry, Honors Principles of Engineering, and more. As of right now, I am taking AP U.S History, AP Calculus AB, AP Computer Science A, AP Spanish Language, AP Environmental Science, and Honors English.

        <section class="containerbackground1 opacity1" style="margin-bottom: 8vw;">
          I am a student and a prospective programmer who is enrolled in a variety of classes that correlate with my interests. For example, I took Computer Science Principles as a freshmen, Principles of Engineering as a sophomore (a class that I loved), and AP Computer Science Applications currently. I also involve myself in other stuff such as the Envirotech club and the Robotics club, both of which help grow my knowledge in engineering. For fun, I actively play tennis and also practice the violin.
